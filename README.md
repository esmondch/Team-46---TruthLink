# TruthLink – Empowering Communities to Combat Misinformation  

## 🧠 Inspiration  
In today's digital age, misinformation spreads rapidly, especially on social media. With the rise of AI-generated deepfakes and manipulated content, verifying the authenticity of information has become a pressing challenge. **TruthLink** was inspired by the need to create a **community-driven** platform where users can collaboratively verify questionable information while ensuring real-user participation through **SingPass authentication**.  

## 💡 What it does  
TruthLink is a **forum-based platform** that allows users to:  
1. **Post questionable information** for community verification.  
2. **Engage in discussions** with other users to analyze the credibility of content.  
3. **Ensure authenticity** by requiring SingPass authentication for user signups. 
4. **Seek expert input** from **professional volunteers** who can contribute at their own discretion. 

*(Future Feature)* **AI-powered fact-checking** for instant verification.  
*(Future Feature)* **Duplicate detection** to prevent repetitive posts and suggest existing discussions.  

## 🛠️ How we built it
